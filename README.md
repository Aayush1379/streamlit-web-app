A Streamlit web application that lets analysts run data analysis by clicking buttons and picking options. It ties Pandas, SQL Server, and simple UI controls into a single app you can run locally or deploy. Use it to explore data, create visuals, filter records, and export results without writing code in each session.

Getting started

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- pip
- (Optional) Windows: ODBC driver for SQL Server
- Access to a SQL Server instance (or use local CSV files)

Recommended Python packages
- streamlit
- pandas
- sqlalchemy (for SQL Server)
- pyodbc (if using ODBC)
- matplotlib / seaborn / plotly
- openpyxl (for Excel export)

Install from source (developer / custom changes)
1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aayush1379/streamlit-web-app.git
   cd streamlit-web-app
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

Download and run a release
- Visit the releases page and download the latest packaged asset. The asset includes a ready-to-run bundle or zip. After download, extract and execute the included start script or binary.
- Release link: https://github.com/Aayush1379/streamlit-web-app/releases
- Typical steps after download (example for a zip release):
  1. Unzip the asset.
  2. Open a terminal in the extracted folder.
  3. If the release included a script (start.sh or start.bat), run it. If it included source files, run:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

App layout and workflows

Main panels
- Sidebar: data source selection, connection settings, global filters
- Top bar: quick actionsâ€”reload, save config, open SQL runner
- Main area: dataset preview, visualization canvas, transform controls
- Bottom: logs and error panel

Common flows
- Quick preview: choose a dataset, click "Preview". The app shows the first 1000 rows and basic stats.
- Visualize: pick a numeric field and a categorical field, then choose chart type. Click "Render".
- SQL Explorer: run parameterized SQL queries against your SQL Server connection. Save queries as named snippets.
- Export: After filters or transforms, click "Export" and select CSV or XLSX.

Connecting to SQL Server

Use SQLAlchemy or pyodbc. Example connection string pattern:
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

conn_str = (
    "mssql+pyodbc://{user}:{password}@{server}:{port}/{database}"
    "?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server"
)
engine = create_engine(conn_str.format(
    user="dbuser", password="secret", server="db.server.com",
    port=1433, database="mydb"
))
```

- Use the app sidebar to store connection profiles.
- The app supports integrated Windows auth and SQL auth.
- The SQL runner UI sends parameter values separately to prevent SQL injection.

Data handling patterns

Use Pandas behind the scenes
- The app loads result sets into DataFrame objects.
- Use caching where appropriate to avoid repeated queries:
  ```python
  @st.cache_data
  def load_data(query, params):
      return pd.read_sql(query, engine, params=params)
  ```
- The UI exposes common transforms as buttons: drop nulls, fill values, cast types, rename columns.

Memory tips
- Limit preview rows to 1,000.
- Stream large queries in batches if the result set exceeds memory.
- Use SQL-level aggregation when possible to reduce transfer size.

Visualization details

Chart types included
- Line: time series and trend analysis
- Bar: categorical counts and comparisons
- Scatter: correlation and outlier detection
- Histogram: distribution check
- Heatmap: correlation matrix visual
- Custom: pass DataFrame to Plotly for interactive charts

Example render flow
1. Select x and y fields.
2. Choose aggregation (sum, mean, count).
3. Apply grouping fields.
4. Click "Render".
5. Use the chart toolbar to zoom or export image.

Export and sharing
- Export data to CSV or Excel with one click.
- Copy plots as PNG or save JSON spec for Plotly.
- Save the current app session config to a JSON file for repeatable runs.

Deployment

Deploy options
- Streamlit Cloud: push your branch and connect repo. Use automatic start command: streamlit run app.py
- Docker:
  - Example Dockerfile:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.10-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . /app
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
    EXPOSE 8501
    CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
    ```
- Heroku: use a Procfile with web: streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT

Environment variables
- Store secrets in environment variables or secret stores:
  - DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_HOST, DB_NAME
  - STREAMLIT_SESSION_STATE_SECRET

Error handling and logging

UI error panel
- The app captures exceptions and shows a user-friendly message with a toggled stack trace.
- For recoverable errors, the UI offers retry or reset options.

Logging
- The app writes logs to a local file and to stdout for containerized runs.
- Log levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
- Use the logs to trace failed queries or transform errors.

Typical troubleshooting steps
- If the app fails to connect to SQL Server, verify network, credentials, and driver.
- Check the logs and the error panel for trace.
- Restart the app to clear in-memory state.

Extending the app

Add a new transform
1. Create a function that accepts and returns a DataFrame.
2. Register it to the transforms registry.
3. Add a UI control in transforms pane that calls the function.

Add a new chart
1. Implement a chart renderer that receives DataFrame and options.
2. Add a mapping in the chart selector UI.
3. Provide sample defaults and validation.

Security

- Avoid embedding credentials in code.
- Use parameterized queries and ORM to prevent injection.
- Run the app behind an authentication proxy for public deployments.

Command-line options
- Set a default port:
  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
  ```
- Use configuration file (.streamlit/config.toml) for persistent settings.

CI / CD
- Use GitHub Actions to run tests and publish releases.
- Example steps:
  - Run lint and unit tests
  - Build release artifact (zip)
  - Upload to GitHub Releases
